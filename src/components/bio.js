          My background is based in neurosurgery. I have been a surgical nurse
          since 1993. I have been an aesthetic nurse injector since 2011 and
          have been OSHOT certified since 2017. What I love most about my work
          is helping women achieve their happiest self through enhanced beauty
          and enhanced intimacy.
